A United States Geological Survey Locus map depicting the Site location has been During testing of the Site AEG identified a foreign soil pile which was placed there at an unknown and from an unknown source. Testing of pile for Priority Pollutant 13 metals, total hydrocarbon poly-nuclear aromatic hydrocarbons and field screening for volatile using a photo-ionization detector showed arsenic to be the only detected analyte in excess of RIDEM Direct Exposure Criteria Subsequent testing of the pile for arsenic confirmed consistency of its presence. Based upon the Site conditions, AEG is preparing to abate the soil via and disposal at a licensed facility using the and Attached hereto, please find a completed and executed RIDEM Release Notification Form in addition associated If you have any questions or concerns please contact the undersigned at Very truly Alliance Environmental Group, ye 7 ya Project Enc.
